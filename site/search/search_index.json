With a BS in Bioinformatics, and a MSc in Bioinformatics and Genomics, I live in Rhode Island with my partner and son. I am currently a Senior Bioinformatics Developer at Theiagen Genomics, where I am a major contributor to our rapidly growing codebase. I've been a part of Theiagen since February 2022. When not crunching data or writing code, I enjoy spending time with my family, playing the violin in a local community orchestra, knitting, and reading. Experience Theiagen Genomics Feb 2022 - Present Fully Remote Senior Bioinformatics Developer Aug 2024 - Present Bioinformatics Scientist Feb 2022 - Aug 2024 During my time at Theiagen Genomics, I have led the development of several bioinformatics WDL pipelines and Python tools, including a Mycobacterium tuberculosis antimicrobial resistance interpretation tool ( tbp-parser ), and a tool that prepares genomic data and metadata for submission to GISAID and NCBI's Sequence Read Archive and BioSample data respositories ( Mercury ). As one of the primary contributions to Theiagen's Public Health Bioinformatics codebase, I have mentored junior developers and organized the team to meet deadlines, resolve issues, and add new features in order to develop pipelines for public health surveillance and outbreak response. In addition, I contributed to several other projects on GitHub, such as the StaPH-B docker builds repository, in order to make bioinformatics tools more accessible to public health professionals. I also was responsible for innovating the company's use of Google Cloud Platform, primarily using Google Batch and Google Workflows to interact with BigQuery, Looker, and Looker Data Studio, among others. I am familiar with GCP Compute, Storage, and other services provided in the Google Cloud suite, including their command line tools and web interface. Pennsylvania Department of Health Bureau of Laboratories Jun 2021 - Feb 2022 Exton, Pennsylvania Bioinformatician As the first bioinformatician hired by the state of Pennsylvania, I was responsible for setting up their bioinformatics infrastructure and establishing industry best practices for the future. In order to enable the rapid data analysis of organisms of public health concern to enable appropriate outbreak responses and epidemiological tracing, I elected to establish cloud-based bioinformatics infrastructure using Google Cloud, specifically using the Terra.bio platform developed by the Broad Institute. Due to the timing of my position, I primarily analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomes to ensure proper sequencing quality, lineage identification, and phylogenetic tree analysis to help track the evolution of the virus during the pandemic.
